# CastleWindsorTypedFactoryExample
This is an example of how to use a Typed-Factory to avoid injecting your container as a dependency to call on `Resolve<>()`

In this example you'll see usage of the typed-factory, injection of classes that have a mix of parameters in the constructor (resolvable and those known only at runtime)
